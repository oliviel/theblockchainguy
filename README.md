# My personal blog about blokchain development

Here I will write about blockchain topics like:

- Solidity.
- Front end development tools like web3 and Ethers.
- The latest news and topics about blockchain development.
- Good resources to learn and upcoming tools.

I made this blog with these tools:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org/)
- [Mdx](https://mdxjs.com/)

If you want me to write about a specific blockchain topic you can
open an issue about it.

To run the project you can use these commands:

1. Enables graphql playground and access to your dev environment to other devices

```sh
npm run develop
```

2. Enables graphiql and remove access to your dev environment to other devices
```sh
npm start
```

Feel free to fork the project and made your own modificarions.
