With the recent boom of blockchain development, many developers want to know the best tools to start working in this new and amazing world. If you spend 10 seconds googling or searching out the advice of blockchains communities, the most popular options that everyone will gonna talk about are [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) and [Remix](https://remix-project.org/).

These are really good blockchain development environments to compile, test and deploy blockchain software. But at the end of the day, is hard to not start doing comparisons of which tool is the best for your project necessities and which one will save you time and gives you the best development experience.

This article is a comparison between Hardhat, Truffle, and Remix, focusing on their characteristics and ecosystem to be able to make a decision of which library to use for your particular use case.

  What is Hardhat?
</h2>

Hardhat was created by [Nomiclabs](https://nomiclabs.io/), helps developers to manage and automate the common tasks of the process of building smart contracts and Dapps, as easily introducing more functionality around this workflow. That means you can compile, run and test smart contracts at the very core.

It focuses on solidity debugging, presents explicit stack traces and error messages when transactions fail. Hardhat comes built-in with Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network designed for development, and a CLI to interact with the core functionalities.

Example of he Hardhat CLI:

```bash
$ npx hardhat
888    888                      888 888               888

  What is Truffle?
</h2>

Truffle was created by [Consensys](https://consensys.net/), is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). With Truffle you get a lot of important characteristics that can help you to develop Dapps like an interactive console for direct contract communication, network management to deploy to any public and private network, contract compilation, linking, and binary management.

Another part of the Truffle ecosystem is [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) a local Ethereum blockchain for test solidity contracts, you can use Ganache in two different ways you can use the [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) (the most complete version) or you can use the [Ganache UI](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/overview) (the most friendly version especially for beginners) is up to you to test and see which version do you prefer.

<figure>
  <img src={ganache} alt="Ganache UI" />
  <figcaption className="italic my-2">Ganache UI running.</figcaption>
</figure>

Sooner or later you will have to develop a UI so the people can start to interacat with your Dapps, thats why Ganache has [Drizzle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/drizzle) a collection of front end libraries. The core of Drizzle uses redux so you can use all the tools available around redux and leave the synchronization of contract and transaction data to redux.

  What is Remix?
</h2>

Remix is an open source web and desktop app. Remix is used for write, test and deploy smart contracts, you can use it as a playground to learn and teach blockchain development. The Remix IDE (every time you see remix in this article, I am talking about the Remix IDE unless specify the contrary) is part of the Remix project which is a platform for development tools that use a plugin architecture.

Remix is composed of a chain of sub-projects including Remix Plugin Engine, Remix Libs, and of course Remix IDE. It is written in javascript and supports a browser and desktop version.

  Documentation
</h2>

The Hardhat [documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) is very clear and organized, you can find different guides of how to start with hardhat from the basics of the CLI to start running your local blockchain until the core aspects of harhat as the tasks, plugins, typescript support, and how to deal with different frameworks and integrations.

Another really helpful section of the documentation is the [tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/) page. This is a step to step guide to create a simple smart contract from the scratch with the help of Hardhat and how to use the contract code in the Front End with React. This is very useful to start to figure out how to use Hardhat and even if you are new in blockchain development, is a good resource to know how to put everything together.

The downside of the documentation is you will not find a lot of tutorials or videos outside of the main documentation or the inner communities, at least at the moment writing this article. The good thing is more companies and developers are creating resources and articles on how to use simple and complex functionalities, plus adding feedback on how to resolve the most common problems and issues this is really crucial to growing the popularity of any library or framework.

  Documentation
</h2>

The Truffle [documentation](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview) is clear and you can start learning the basics of how to create a project, migrating with Truffle develop or Ganache, connect Truffle to metamask and start interacting with the contracts.

Truffle has a guides section to guide you to common tasks of Truffle development, these guides are not a step by step guide of a single project and are not so updated. The good side is that Truffle is not a new tool for blockchain development, there are more articles and tutorials out there, so you can find many resources because of the longevity and development ecosystem built around it.

<h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold flex items-center">

  />
  Documentation
</h2>

The Remix [documentation](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is made in a way that even you are not experienced developing blockchain software will be easy for you to start learning. You will see multiple images with arrows and text to identify each tool of Remix so, you will familiarize yourself with it very fast and you will start to customize Remix for your own necessities. The documentation is not just limited to show you parts of the UI, they show you how to use remix with different integrations for example [Hardhat](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardhat.html), how to do unit testing, and other important aspects to master Remix.

<figure>
  <img src={solCompiler} alt="explanation of remix compiler" />
  <figcaption className="italic my-2">
    Example of Remix documentation explaining the compiler tab.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The other good part is they update the documentation frequently, this is a very good thing because the documentation about blockchain tools generally is not updated and this is an important aspect for this very changing environment even if you see an error you can open an issue on Github or fix that edit yourself and made a pull request to the documentation repo.

<figure>
  <img src={githubEdit} alt="remix docs github edit" />
  <figcaption className="italic my-2">

  Community
</h2>

The community is very active and helpful, you can find the core members and experienced developers in the official [Discord server](https://hardhat.org/discord) there you can find many channels for different topics related to Hardhat and the friendly help of many members.

The downside of community is the fact that you only will find more specific help in the Discord server, there is not a support forum or many questions related or resolved about Hardhat in places like StackOverflow because is relatively new but the good part is this will change with time and the usage.

<h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold flex items-center">

  Community
</h2>

The community of Truffle is not behind other developers communities you can find all the community channels in the [community](https://www.trufflesuite.com/community) section of the main Truffle website, I recommend asking questions in the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bZwrf3x4Vs) of Consensys there is a channel just about Truffle. Therefore, you can ask all the questions you have and you will have an answer as soon as possible.

You can find answers when you are stuck outside of the main community channels, on places like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=truffle) or [Stackexchange](https://stackexchange.com/search?q=truffle) the community is big, so finding answers in these places and other kinds of blogs or forums are something common.

  Community
</h2>

The community of Remix is very supportive, you can find the answer of your questions if you are stuck in the main channel of the [gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/remix) and ask for help from any member of the community.

If you want to help to develop a custom plugin or you have doubts to develop a plugin for you or the company you work can go to the [contributors’ channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/remix-dev) if you want more information about working on Remix tools.

The community have sometime around, to find answers in other places outside of the main community, when you are stuck your primary source will be [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=remix) and then followed by [Stackexchange](https://stackexchange.com).

  Libraries and Plugins
</h2>

Hardhat has a complete ecosystem around plugins. Plugins are the backbone of Hardhat, they are pieces of reusable configuration that you can use in any kind of project, you can use official plugins made by Hardhat, you can use plugins made by other members of the Hardhat community or you can [make your own](https://hardhat.org/advanced/building-plugins.html).

Plugins behind the scenes are extending the [Hardhat Runtime Environment (HRE)](https://hardhat.org/advanced/hardhat-runtime-environment.html), defining new tasks or overriding existing ones. For example, you can create a plugin to read your solidity code and create hooks ready to use for React.

You can create a basic plugin addign this to `hardhat.config.js`

```jsx
// Will make hi available everywhere where the environment is accessible
extendEnvironment((hre) => {
  hre.hi = "Hello, Hardhat!";
});

task("envhello", (args, hre) => {
  console.log(hre.hi);
});

module.exports = {};
});
```

Output:

```bash
$ npx hardhat envhello
Hello, Hardhat!
```

<h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold flex items-center">
  <img
    style={{ width: "34px", marginRight: "8px" }}
    src={truffleIcon}
    alt="truffle icon"
  />
  Libraries and Plugins
</h2>

The ecosystem of Truffle is around [boxes](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes). Truffle boxes are helpful boilerplates that speed up your project development so you can focus on the important parts. Boxes have a combination of solidity contracts, libraries, and front end ready to use, you can find official boxes, made by the community or you can [make your own](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/advanced/creating-a-truffle-box) too.

Each Box essentially revolves around a `truffle-box.json` configuration file. This file dictates what commands should be run at the point of unboxing so that it’s ready to go. If you're starting from scratch, there is [blueprint](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes/blueprint) box with the configuration file with common values.

```json
// Example of truffle-box.json
{
  "ignore": ["README.md", ".gitignore"],
  "commands": {
    "Compile contracts": "truffle compile",
    "Migrate contracts": "truffle migrate",
    "Test contracts": "truffle test"
  },
  "hooks": {
    "post-unpack": ""
  }
}
```

The downside of boxes is not flexible when you want specific things. You have to use the complete box not just a part of it, and when you want to override or extend Truffle to add specific functionality, like generate a UML grammar for each contract and use it in different projects, this is not an easy functionality to add.

<h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold flex items-center">
  <img
    style={{ width: "34px", marginRight: "8px" }}
    src={remixIcon}
    alt="remix icon"
  />
  Libraries and Plugins
</h2>

Remix has a plugin manager, where you can access the plugins made by the Remix team ([solidity compiler](https://github.com/dexfair/celo-remix-plugin), [solidity unit testing](https://github.com/ethereum/remix)) and made by other members of the community ([optimism compiler](https://github.com/Machinalabs/remix-optimism-compiler-plugin/issues), [celo](https://github.com/dexfair/celo-remix-plugin)). If you click the icon plug you will see the list of all available plugins, you can connect local plugins made by [yourself](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-plugin) when you want to create a custom functionality of your project.

<figure>
  <img src={remixPlugins} alt="list of remix plugins" />
  <figcaption className="italic my-2">
    The plugin manager of Remix with the list of all the available plugins.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The downside of the plugins of Remix is there is not a diversity of plugins, but this will be fixed when the blockchain ecosystem grows and more developers participate in coding and provide more plugins for each framework.

  Testing
</h2>

To test your smart contracts with Hardhat you have to use javascript or typescript. The most popular option to test your contracts is the library [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) to interact with the smarts contracts and [Waffle](https://getwaffle.io/) to test the smarts contracts (tests using Waffle are written with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)).

Example of the test using Ethers.js and Waffle:

```js
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Greeter", function () {
  it("Should return the new greeting once it's changed", async function () {
    const Greeter = await ethers.getContractFactory("Greeter");
    const greeter = await Greeter.deploy("Hello, world!");
    await greeter.deployed();

    expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal("Hello, world!");

    const setGreetingTx = await greeter.setGreeting("Hola, mundo!");

    await setGreetingTx.wait();

    expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal("Hola, mundo!");
  });
});
```

Output:

```bash
$ npx hardhat test

  Contract: Greeter
    ✓ Should return the new greeting once it's changed (762ms)

  1 passing (762ms)
```

You can use Truffle and [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/) too to test your smart contracts, with this you will have compatibility with the [@truffle/contract](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@truffle/contract) package. Truffle 4 and Truffle 5 are supported using the [@nomiclabs/hardhat-truffle4](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-truffle4.html) and [@nomiclabs/hardhat-truffle5](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-truffle5.html).

Example of a test using Web3.js and Truffle:

```js
const Greeter = artifacts.require("Greeter");

// Truffle test
contract("Greeter", (accounts) => {
  it("Should return the new greeting once it's changed", async function () {
    const greeter = await Greeter.new("Hello, world!");
    assert.equal(await greeter.greet(), "Hello, world!");

    await greeter.setGreeting("Hola, mundo!");

    assert.equal(await greeter.greet(), "Hola, mundo!");
  });
});

describe("Greeter contract", function () {
  let accounts;

  before(async function () {
    accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
  });

  describe("Deployment", function () {
    it("Should deploy with the right greeting", async function () {
      const greeter = await Greeter.new("Hello, world!");
      assert.equal(await greeter.greet(), "Hello, world!");

      const greeter2 = await Greeter.new("Hola, mundo!");
      assert.equal(await greeter2.greet(), "Hola, mundo!");
    });
  });
});
```

Output:

```bash
$ npx hardhat test

Contract: Greeter
    ✓ Should return the new greeting once it's changed (265ms)

  Greeter contract
    Deployment
      ✓ Should deploy with the right greeting (114ms)


  2 passing (398ms)
```

  Testing
</h2>

Truffle comes with a suite of testing libraries to make testing easier out of the box, the first way to test your smart contracts is with javascript and typescript. Truffle comes with Mocha, Chai, and Web3.js to write javascript tests.

```js
const MetaCoin = artifacts.require("MetaCoin");

contract("2nd MetaCoin test", async (accounts) => {
  it("should put 10000 MetaCoin in the first account", async () => {
    const instance = await MetaCoin.deployed();
    const balance = await instance.getBalance.call(accounts[0]);
    assert.equal(balance.valueOf(), 10000);
  });

  it("should call a function that depends on a linked library", async () => {
    const meta = await MetaCoin.deployed();
    const outCoinBalance = await meta.getBalance.call(accounts[0]);
    const metaCoinBalance = outCoinBalance.toNumber();
    const outCoinBalanceEth = await meta.getBalanceInEth.call(accounts[0]);
    const metaCoinEthBalance = outCoinBalanceEth.toNumber();
    assert.equal(metaCoinEthBalance, 2 * metaCoinBalance);
  });

  it("should send coin correctly", async () => {
    const account_one = accounts[0];
    const account_two = accounts[1];
    let balance;

    const amount = 10;

    const instance = await MetaCoin.deployed();
    const meta = instance;

    balance = await meta.getBalance.call(account_one);
    const account_one_starting_balance = balance.toNumber();

    balance = await meta.getBalance.call(account_two);
    const account_two_starting_balance = balance.toNumber();
    await meta.sendCoin(account_two, amount, { from: account_one });

    balance = await meta.getBalance.call(account_one);
    const account_one_ending_balance = balance.toNumber();

    balance = await meta.getBalance.call(account_two);
    const account_two_ending_balance = balance.toNumber();

    assert.equal(
      account_one_ending_balance,
      account_one_starting_balance - amount,
      "Amount wasn't correctly taken from the sender"
    );
    assert.equal(
      account_two_ending_balance,
      account_two_starting_balance + amount,
      "Amount wasn't correctly sent to the receiver"
    );
  });
});
```

Output:

```bash
Contract: MetaCoin
    √ should put 10000 MetaCoin in the first account (83ms)
    √ should call a function that depends on a linked library (43ms)
    √ should send coin correctly (122ms)


  3 passing (293ms)
```

The other way to make tests is in Solidity, for test your contracts in scenarios more advanced. Truffle's Solidity testing framework was made with these kinds of issues in mind:

- ▪︎ Solidity tests shouldn't extend from any contract. This gives you complete control of the contracts you write.

- ▪︎ Solidity tests shouldn't be beholden to any assertion library. Truffle comes with a default assertion library, but you can change this library to fit your project requirements.

- ▪︎ You should be able to run your Solidity tests against any Ethereum client.

Example of solidity test:

```js
pragma solidity >=0.4.25 <0.6.0;

import "truffle/Assert.sol";
import "truffle/DeployedAddresses.sol";
import "../contracts/MetaCoin.sol";

contract TestMetaCoin {
  function testInitialBalanceUsingDeployedContract() {
    MetaCoin meta = MetaCoin(DeployedAddresses.MetaCoin());

    uint expected = 10000;

    Assert.equal(meta.getBalance(tx.origin), expected, "Owner should have 10000 MetaCoin initially");
  }

  function testInitialBalanceWithNewMetaCoin() {
    MetaCoin meta = new MetaCoin();

    uint expected = 10000;

    Assert.equal(meta.getBalance(tx.origin), expected, "Owner should have 10000 MetaCoin initially");
  }
}
```

Output:

```bash
$ truffle test

Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Compiling ./test/TestMetaCoin.sol

  TestMetaCoin
    ✓ testInitialBalanceWithNewMetaCoin (65ms)

  Contract: MetaCoin
    ✓ should put 10000 MetaCoin in the first account (38ms)

  1 passing (7s)
```

  Testing
</h2>

Testing with Remix is done only with solidity and is the easiest way to implement tests to your smart contracts especially when you are starting to learn about blockchain development. The solidity unit testing plugin is already active and you will see a contract test example to have an example of how testing works inside Remix.

Example of solidity test with Remix:

```jsx
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
import "remix_tests.sol"; // this import is automatically injected by Remix.
import "../contracts/3_Ballot.sol";

contract BallotTest {

    bytes32[] proposalNames;

    Ballot ballotToTest;
    function beforeAll () public {
        proposalNames.push(bytes32("candidate1"));
        ballotToTest = new Ballot(proposalNames);
    }

    function checkWinningProposal () public {
        ballotToTest.vote(0);
        Assert.equal(ballotToTest.winningProposal(), uint(0), "proposal at index 0 should be the winning proposal");
        Assert.equal(ballotToTest.winnerName(), bytes32("candidate1"), "candidate1 should be the winner name");
    }

    function checkWinninProposalWithReturnValue () public view returns (bool) {
        return ballotToTest.winningProposal() == 0;
    }

  Popularity
</h2>

Fortunately to know who are the most used blockchain framework you can consult the data from the last [solidity developer survey 2020](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/01/26/solidity-developer-survey-2020-results/). The survey received 193 responses from 48 different countries. In the question about Ethereum-specific development environment, Truffle was the most popular with 35% of responses, followed by Remix 29% and Hardhat 23%.

Even if this is a small number of people participating in this survey, you can have an idea of how are these frameworks distributed around professionals and amateurs blockchain devs.

  Conclusion
</h2>

With all the information in this article, you may have a better idea of the options that give you the most popular blockchain development tools, maybe you even know what option you want to start your next project.

My advice is you can start with Remix because you don't even have to deal with installing dependencies in your local and you can start without so much trouble coding and learn the basics of solidity, testing, and deployment to test net even mainnets.

Then you can go with Hardhat because of its unopinionated nature, you can install what you exactly want and expand the Hardhat Runtime Environment, good documentation and the growing community is one of the reasons why many companies and myself use Hardhat as our main blockchain development tool.

At the end of the day, the only thing you need to do is start with a tool and start creating things with it, then you can translate all the knowledge you have to any tool. The most important thing is the knowledge and experienced that will lead any project you want without worried about too much about the tool you are using.
